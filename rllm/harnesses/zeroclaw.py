"""ZeroClawHarness: runs the ZeroClaw CLI agent inside the sandbox.

ZeroClaw (https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) is a single Rust binary
"autonomous AI personal assistant". Unlike env-var-driven CLIs (mini-swe-agent)
it is **config-file driven**: it reads ``~/.zeroclaw/config.toml`` for provider
credentials, model, and autonomy policy. So the load-bearing method here is
:meth:`write_configs`, which emits that TOML pointing ZeroClaw's OpenAI-
compatible client at the rLLM gateway.

Three facts established from the ZeroClaw docs/installer:

1. **Install** via the official installer with ``--prebuilt --skip-onboard``
   (downloads a checksum-verified release binary; no Rust toolchain needed).
   The binary lands in ``$CARGO_HOME/bin/zeroclaw`` (``/root/.cargo/bin`` when
   installed as root, which the install hook does).
2. **One-shot, non-interactive** execution is ``zeroclaw agent -m "<prompt>"``
   ("if -m is provided, runs a single turn and exits").
3. **Autonomy** must be ``level = "full"`` for the agent to run shell/filesystem
   tools without interactive approval (``Supervised`` — the default — blocks
   them and the agent stalls in a non-interactive sandbox; cf. issue #851).

``run()`` returns ``None``; the gateway captures every LLM call and the engine
reconstructs the trajectory. ZeroClaw's stdout is tee'd to ``stdout_log_path``
for debugging only.
