r"""Single-turn math agent.

The agent receives a math problem and returns reasoning followed by a
final answer in ``\boxed{...}`` notation, in a single LLM call. The
full assistant response is stored on the episode so the evaluator
extracts the boxed answer and grades it against ground truth.

This is the no-tool counterpart to ``cookbooks/math_tool_agent/`` and
covers the workload of the legacy ``examples/{deepscaler, simple_math,
gsm8k_lora, math_tinker}`` examples in one cookbook.

        "ground_truth" or "answer": str, # boxed answer or numeric value
